  <p>
    I am an incoming PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu">University
      of Florida</a>, working with <a
      href="https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/xilei-zhao/">Dr. Xilei
      Zhao</a> in the <a href="https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/sermos-lab/">SERMoS
      Lab</a> at the intersection of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and
    <b>Transportation Engineering</b>. My current research focuses on developing
    interpretable machine learning models with fairness constraints for
    transportation systems, including a unified framework for addressing
    fairness across the entire travel modeling pipeline (trip generation,
    destination distribution, mode choice, and traffic assignment). I am also
    exploring bi-directional fairness frameworks to prevent biases from
    propagating between modeling stages.

    I will graduating from <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu">Colorado
      College</a> this May with a double major in <b>Computer Science</b> and
    <b>Mathematics</b>, where I developed <b>FORMAL</b>â€”an AI system that
    integrates Retrieval-Augmented Thinking and agentic feedback loops for
    translating informal mathematics into Lean 4 code with 92% syntactic
    correctness.

    My research interests include <b>LLM Agents</b>, <b>Trustworthy AI</b>, and
    <b>AI for Transportation</b>. I'm particularly excited about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing interpretable and fair AI models for transportation demand
      forecasting that balance predictive accuracy with equity
      considerations</li>
    <li>Developing integrated approaches to ensure fairness across multi-stage
      travel modeling pipelines</li>
    <li>Creating real-time digital twins powered by LLM-based agents for
      adaptive transportation systems monitoring and management</li>
    <li>Building robust validation frameworks for agent-based transportation
      models with resource-efficient architectures</li>
  </ul>
