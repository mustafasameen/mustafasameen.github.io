  <p>
  I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the SERMoS Lab at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a>, advised by <a href="https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/xilei-zhao/">Dr. Xilei Zhao</a>, joining the <a href="https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/sermos-lab/"><u>SERMoS Lab</u></a> this Fall. I graduate this May from <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu">Colorado College</a> with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
  My research sits at the intersection of AI and transportation engineering. Iâ€™m currently focused on:
  (A) Spatio-temporal demand forecasting using LLM-based agents
  (B) Multi-agent LLM systems for adaptive, real-time digital twins
  (C) Fairness-aware, interpretable models across multi-stage travel-model pipelines
